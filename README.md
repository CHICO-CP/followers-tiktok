# TikTok Automation Script

This is an automation script that Pyppeteer uses to interact with TikTok. It allows you to log in to TikTok, search for a user, follow them, like their videos, and make predefined comments.

## Requirements

Before running the script, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pyppeteer (`pip install pyppeteer`)
- asyncio (comes pre-installed with Python 3.7+)
- JSON files with user information and comments.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CHICO-CP/followers-tiktok.git
   ```
   ```bash
   cd followers-tiktok
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
pip install pyppeteer
```

3. Create the JSON files of users and comments by running the script. Files are automatically generated if they don't exist.

```bash
python TikTok-followers.py
```

Use

1. Modify the tiktok_users.json file with your TikTok user credentials:

```bash
{
    "users": [
        {"username": "your_tiktok_username", "password": "your_password"}
    ]
}
```

2. Edit the comments.json file with the comments you want to be posted:

```bash
{
    "comments": [
        "Buen video",
        "Eres el mejor",
        "Sigue as√≠"
    ]
}
```

3. Run the script:

```bash
python script.py
```
You'll be asked to enter the name of the user you want to search for on TikTok.

**Comment on videos: Post random comments from a predefined list in the comments.json file.**


# JSON files
